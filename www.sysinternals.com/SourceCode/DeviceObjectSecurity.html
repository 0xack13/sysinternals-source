    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Windows NT DDK has very little security-related information, documenting only four functions (<b>SeAccessCheck</b>, 
        <b>SeAssignSecurity</b>, <b>SeDeassignSecurity</b>, and <b>SeSinglePrivilegeCheck</b>). Its most glaring omission, however, is related to device 
        objects. Nowhere in the DDK does it state what default permissions are applied to device objects upon their creation. The vast 
        majority of device driver developers assume that the "appropriate" permissions are enabled, or don't realize that securing 
        device objects is an issue at all. When I integrated <a href="../Utilities/WinObj.html">WinObj V2.0</a> with NT's security editors, a brief tour through the \device 
        object directory showed me that overlooking device object security could inadvertently open security holes. The vast majority 
        of device objects created have the following permissions: Everyone:Read/Write (R/W) (the Everyone built-in Security Identifier 
        -SID - is also known as the World SID), System:Full Access, and Administrator:Full Access. Only Microsoft's file server and file 
        redirector (LanManServer and LanManRedirector) objects omit Everyone:Write and just allow Everyone:Read, and physical disks are 
        protected because the device object directory in which they're located, \device\harddiskxxx, omit Everyone:R/W.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it makes sense for some objects to have Everyone:R/W, allowing any account to read and write to most devices is not 
        acceptable. Having R/W not only enables an account to perform ReadFile and WriteFile on devices, but execute any device-defined 
        I/O control requests as well. For example, a disk controller that can be directly accessed by a malicious user or Guest could 
        prove disastrous. The release of Microsoft Terminal Server (Hydra), which makes NT a multi-user system, heightens the risk of 
        potential device security breaches.
    </p>
    
    <h2>IoCreateDevice</h2>
    <p>
        Why does Everyone:R/W show up on most device objects? Because <b>IoCreateDevice</b>, the kernel-mode API used to create device objects, 
        assigns the permissions I list above as default permissions - its up to a device driver to adjust the permissions if necessary, 
        like SRV and RDR obviously do. Unfortunately, the NT DDK does not document the kernel-mode functions necessary to remove an Access 
        Control Entry (ACE), like the one that grants Everyone read and write access, from a device object's Discretionary Access Control 
        List (DACL). Microsoft has been made aware of this deficiency, and will be creating and documenting new kernel-mode APIs for NT 
        5.0 that will make it easy to create device objects without weak protection. I'll present these new APIs here when they are available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, the mapping between Win32 security APIs and kernel-mode security APIs is fairly straight-forward. This has 
        enabled me to implement a function, NTIRemoveWorldAce, for use in your own device drivers. This function and its support 
        routines, demonstrated in the secsys sample driver, will fully secure your device objects. Its implementation also serves 
        to show the use of kernel-mode security functions in kernel mode. SecDemo The SecDemo program fully demonstrates default 
        object security and the use of <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b>. The program consists of the SecDemo Win32 console program and the SecSys 
        device driver. To see the NTIRemoveWorldAce API remove Everyone:R/W run SecDemo. It will load SecSys, which creates a device 
        object named "\device\secsys" using IoCreateDevice . The program then pauses in order to give you an opportunity to view its 
        default permissions. To do so, start Winobj, navigate to the \device directory, and double-click on "secsys". Then go to the 
        "Security" tab in the Object Properties dialog box that appears and select "Permissions". You'll see the following security 
        information, which includes Everyone:R/W:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/screenshots/DeviceObjectSecurity.gif" width="408" height="305" alt="Device Object Security Screenshot" />
    <p>
        After you have seen <b>IoCreateDevice</b>'s default permissions, press return to let Secdemo continue. It sends an I/O control to the secsys driver that invokes <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b> and pauses again to let you view \device\secsys's updated permissions. Close the secsys Object Properties dialog and double-click on secsys again. When you view its permissions at this point you'll see this:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/screenshots/DeviceObjectSecurity2.gif" width="408" height="305" alt="Device Object Security Screenshot" />
    <p>
        Now only members of the built-in Administrators group and the System (Win32 Services and the NT Kernel) will be able to read, write or send IOCTLs to the secsys device object.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Inside NTIRemoveWorldAce</h2>
    <p>
        I've thoroughly documented the implementation of <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b>, so I'll only provide an overview here. My discussion assumes familiarity with NT's security model and Win32 security APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b> is prototyped as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce( PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR OriginalDescriptor, PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR *UpdatedDescriptor );</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        A device object's security descriptor is stored in DeviceObject->SecurityDescriptor, so secsys uses the API as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce( Device->SecurityDescriptor, &amp;Device-&gt;SecurityDescriptor );</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b> first takes the device object's security descriptor, which is in self-relative form, and creates an 
        equivalent security descriptor in absolute form so that the descriptor can be easily manipulated. The support function 
        <b>NTIMakeAbsoluteSD</b> accomplishes this. <b>NTIMakeAbsoluteSD</b> makes use of the following kernel-mode security APIs to create 
        and fill in the absolute security descriptor:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>RtlCreateSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlGetDaclSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlSetDaclSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlGetOwnerSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlSetOwnerSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlGetGroupSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlSetGroupSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlValidSecurityDescriptor</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I've included prototypes to all these functions, as well as the others used in the sample, in secsys.h. Next to each 
        prototype I list the functions' equivalent Win32 security API (e.g., <b>RtlValidSecurityDescriptor</b>'s equivalent is 
        <b>IsValidSecurityDescriptor</b>), so you can refer to the Win32 SDK's documentation for details on how to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NTIRemoveWorldAce</b> obtains a pointer to the absolute descriptor using <b>RtlGetDaclSecurityDescriptor</b> and then initializes 
        a Security Identifier (SID) that represents the built-in World account. The APIs called upon for this operation include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>RtlLengthRequiredSid</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlInitializeSid</b></li>
        <li><b>RtlSubAuthoritySid</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Next, NTIRemoveWorldAce marches through the DACL's ACE's, searching for one that has the World SID in it. Win32 programs can 
        use GetAce to retrieve a particular ACE from an ACL, but this function is not implemented in kernel-mode. I therefore call my 
        own implementation of GetAce, NTIGetAce, to retrieve pointers to each ACE in the ACL. Using RtlEqualSid I test the SID in an 
        ACE for a match against the World SID that I've initialized. When a match occurs I call NTIDeleteAce, which implements the 
        functionality of the Win32 function DeleteAce. Like GetAce, there is no kernel-mode equivalent provided by NT for DeleteAce.
    </p>
    <p>
        The subsequent steps are to apply the updated DACL to the security descriptor with RtlSetDaclSecurityDescriptor, and to convert the security descriptor back to relative form via RtlAbsoluteToSelfRelativeSD. Finally, the passed in device object security descriptor is deallocated with ExFreePool, and the pointer to receive the new security descriptor (in the case of secsys, the device object's security descriptor pointer) is set to point to the new security descriptor.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Closing Comments</h2>
    <p>
        So is it safe to use these APIs given that they are undocumented? The answer is yes, at least through NT V5.0. There are several reasons to feel safe when using them:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>there is a direct correlation between documented Win32 APIs and their kernel-mode equivalents, down to their identical parameter lists</li>
        <li>Microsoft's own drivers make use of these APIs (otherwise they would not be exported)</li>
        <li>they have existed in all released versions of NT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In this article and sample program I've only scratched the surface of kernel-mode security APIs and their uses. I'll describe other device driver uses for security, such as privilege checking, protecting private objects, and detecting user access, in an upcoming Dr. Dobb's Journal. The article will also provide a header file, ntsec.h, that I've compiled to include all kernel-mode security APIs, their prototypes, their Win32-equivalents, as well as typedefs and definitions required to use the APIs.
